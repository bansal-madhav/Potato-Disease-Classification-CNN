# Potato-Disease-Classification-CNN
Farmers who grows potatoes every year are facing a lot of economical issues because of various kinds of diseases in the potato plant. Basically there are two types of diseases, one is early blight which is caused by a fungus and second is late blight which is caused by microorganisms. If the farmers able to detect these diseases in early stages than the farmers can able to prevent economical loss.

I have created a website in which farmers just need to click the picture of the potato plant and it can tell the type of diseases and behind the scenes it will be using Deep learning and convulational neural network.

Dataset Used->
This data contains three datasets that contains photos of potato leaves. One dataset contains Healthy potato leaves, Early Blight and Late Blight.
